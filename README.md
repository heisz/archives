# Jeff's Archives

Contained within are years and years of older code that was intended to be
open-sourced (or eventually became some of the other code elements you see
elsewhere in my account).  Basically a historical inventory of random bits
of personally owned code from over 30 years of software development.  Been
cleaning up old hard drives and thought I should put it somewhere for
posterity and reference.

Things of interest in here:

* *JEMCC* this was a run at building a JVM natively on the JNI interfaces
