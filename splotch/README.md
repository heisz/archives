# sPLOTch!

This is the *S*cientific *PLOT* *C*ommand *H*ierarchy tool, which is basically
a scientific data plotting program for generating graphical output.

The development of this tool was a crossover between curiousity/learning and
need.  My master's thesis was typeset using SAS/Graph on the mainframe
(hence the familiar syntax if you've used that) and manual cut-and-tape
handling for all legends, labels, etc.  With almost 150 graphs in the thesis,
the final typesetting took almost 56 hours of non-stop work over a lightbox.

For my PhD, no desire to repeat.  Hence this program...
