.TH SP_PS 1 "April 1, 1993" "Version 2.1" "sPLOTch! DRIVERS"
.SH NAME
sp_ps - convert sdvi output to PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sp_ps 
[
.I options
] [
.I filename
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B
sp_ps
reads the sdvi file
.I filename
produced by the sPLOTch! program
and converts it into fully conforming Level 1 PostScript for printing 
purposes.  Normally, the output is automatically forwarded to an appropriate
laserprinter, although it can be redirected into a file or to one of the
standard output channels.  If no 
.I filename
is given,
.I sp_ps
reads the sdvi information from the standard input (for use as a direct
output driver).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c num
Produces
.I num
copies of the output, through the setting of the 
.I #copies
entry in the postscript userdict.  This generates multiple copies of
sPLOTch! output very quickly, as the page description is only processed once.
.TP
.B -e
Disables the use of the 
.I showpage
command in the resulting PostScript output.  This allows the output to
be included as an Extended PostScript diagram by programs which do not
disable the showpage command properly.  Note: multiple page outputs,
which do not lend themselves to EPS file inclusion, will be rather mangled
by the use of this option.
.TP
.B -f
Enables absolute page clipping.  When enabled, the rectangular frame
which encompasses the absolute page boundaries is created, and all
output outside of this frame is clipped.  This is really only meaningful
when the absolute page size is smaller than the actual output page,
where any output leakage beyond the page boundaries may be visible.
.TP
.B -g
Forces the conversion of all colour information into a corresponding
greyscale intensity, via the YIQ colour conversion matrix 
(the Y component is used as
the grey intensity, see an appropriate graphics text for further
information).  This allows greyscale output to be printed on a colour
printer, as it would appear on a 
monochrome (black and white) printing device.
.TP 
.B -h
Prints out a short help file of the options available and any defined
defaults.
.TP
.B -o name
Outputs the PostScript information into the specified file
.I name.
Use of this option overrides the specification of the direct printer
name via the -P option.  If a minus sign (-) is given as the output
filename, the PostScript output is dumped to the standard output
channel.
.TP
.B -P name
Outputs the PostScript information to the specified printer
.I name.
If a minus sign (-) is given as the printer name, the PostScript output
is dumped to the standard error channel.  If no printer name is given,
and no output file is specified using the -o option, the output is sent to
the default printer which has been defined at the time of compilation
(can be determined using the -h option).
.TP
.B -q
Supresses the page output report which is normally printed at the end of
processing (quiet mode).  Intended for use by programs which directly
call
.I sp_ps
for PostScript diagram inclusion.
.TP
.B -s
Prints the sdvi output in landscape orientation (sideways).  Default
page sizes in
.I splotch
assume portrait orientation, but certain output sizes lend themselves to
landscape.  Note: this option is not to be confused with the 
.B rotate
setting in sPLOTch!,
which has the same effect but in a completely different fashion.
.TP
.B -x xdim
Offsets the final output horizontally by
.I xdim
inches.  This is typically used to compensate for misalignments in a
postscript printer, or to adjust the final position of the output.
.TP
.B -y ydim
Offsets the final output vertically by
.I ydim
inches.  Note: the x and y offsets are always applied in the true
page horizontal and vertical directions, regardless of the specification
of the
.I -s
option.

None (except for the input file).
.SH BUGS
.LP
Filled polygons which exceed the internal PostScript limit of 1500 
coordinates in the outline path are not handled correctly (standard
lines are, however).
