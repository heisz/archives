  This is the sPLOTch! Version 2.1 demonstration gallery.  The set of
control programs contained in this directory (all ending with the .sp
suffix) demonstrate the various features of the sPLOTch! programming
language.  Many of these demonstration programs originate from the
Examples section of the sPLOTch! User's Guide.

  There is an automatic demonstration script included in this directory
which should be used to view these programs as a set, entitled RUNME.
This is a shell program, and must be run using the Bourne shell
processor sh, ie.

/bin/sh RUNME

  Enjoy the show!
