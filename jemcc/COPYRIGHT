3rd Party Copyrights
--------------------

Before discussing the copyright information for the JEMCC-specific source
code, it should be noted that there are two collections of code by other
authors embedded in this distribution (each with their own separate
copyrights and licensing terms).

The first is located in the 'configure-scripts' directory and contains
unmodified copies of the shell scripts needed to support the libtool,
automake and autoconf toolkits.  See the README file in this directory for
more information and each file for associated copyright and licensing
information.  Note that these scripts are only included in the source
distribution for the purposes of building/compiling JEMCC and are not part
of the final binary distribution.  As such, their licensing and copyright
restrictions do not play a part in the inclusion of the JEMCC binaries in
distributed applications.

The second collection is the 'zlib' library implementation appearing in
the 'src/engine/zlib' directory.  Again, this is an unmodified copy of the
zlib distribution, aside from the Makefile modifications needed to compile
the library into JEMCC.  See the README file in this directory for additional
information.  In this instance, the zlib code is directly compiled into the
JEMCC binaries and as such its licensing and copyright restrictions would
impact applications incorporating the resulting binaries.  However, the
zlib copyright/license is completely open (see below) aside from the
modification and warranty statements which are compatible with the Gnu Public
Licenses under which the JEMCC source code is released.

A suitable recognition would be to acknowledge the authors of the zlib
package as part of the statements required in using JEMCC under the terms
of the Gnu Public Licenses.  In this spirit, the acknowledgement and
copyright information for the zlib distribution is included below:

Details of the JEMCC Copyright
------------------------------

The copyrights for the authored materials in this distribution follow two
models, as the core virtual machine and associated libraries are intended for
redistribution in other applications, while the toolkit and test components
are intended for development (non-distribution) purposes only.

In general, this software is released under the two GNU licenses - the
General Public License (GPL) and the Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
The terms of these licenses can be found in this distribution in the files
COPYING (GPL) and COPYING.LESSER (LGPL).  Each file in this distribution
declares in its preamble which of the two licenses apply to the contents of
the file.  While the author emphatically supports the GNU initiatives for
free software and understands the rationale for the "desired" release of
software under the more restrictive GPL, the bulk of the JEMCC software is
released under the LGPL.  This is for two reasons:

 - As pointed out on the gnu.org website, the usage of the GPL for a library
   is most desirable when the library adds significant new features, not
   when it provides identical support to libraries available elsewhere.  In
   this particular case, an alternative "library" is always available from Sun.

 - After years of pouring effort into various systems that never see
   production, the author wants his software to be used.  Since the entire
   basis for this software is to provide a lighter application framework
   on which distributable applications could be built, releasing it as GPL
   software could preclude such a usage (even if only due to perception).

To this end, the following statements describe the intents of the author
in providing this code and clarify in less formal terms your rights to use
this software:

1) The code contained in the 'src' directory, along with the jemcc.c file
   in the 'tools' directory, form a complete virtual machine which is capable
   of running Java programs.  The contents of the 'include' directory are
   part of this virtual machine, providing the prototype information for
   extensions to the machine.  This virtual machine is considered by the author
   to be identical to a "library" and is released under the LGPL.  As such,
   you are permitted to bundle and distribute this virtual machine, in whole
   or in part, into your own application (open-source or proprietary),
   according to the following conditions and clarifications:

    a) You must grant the same license to use, modify and distribute the
       JEMCC virtual machine to third parties, including the availability
       and distribution of the source code, as described in the LGPL.
       You do *not* have to grant such license for code and data specific
       to your application running on the JEMCC virtual machine, be it Java
       bytecode, JNI native extensions or JEMCC-based native extensions.
       Note that, as long as you use the conventional dynamic linking
       mechanisms of Java and JEMCC to incorporate your native code, you meet
       the requirements of relinking a "work that uses the Library" as
       described in Section 6 of the LGPL.

    b) Any modifications to the JEMCC virtual machine source code (e.g. bug
       fixes, enhancements, optimizations, etc.), which do not completely
       replace a component must be licensed under the LGPL with all of the
       associated terms and conditions.  In this case, replacing an entire
       class with your own independently produced implementation is the
       appropriate metric for when this does not apply.  Changes to the
       core of the virtual machine (not being a class in itself) should be
       licensed under the LGPL.  Hopefully you will see fit to send any
       modifications back to the author for the betterment of all.

       NOTE: all non-proprietrary modifications must be performed in a
       "clean-room" manner (see Section (4) below) if they are to be
       incorporated back into the JEMCC distribution.

    c) Should you choose to introduce a proprietary replacement for a JEMCC
       bound class according to (b) above, you must bind this to your
       application as a separate component, not within the original JEMCC
       libraries themselves (i.e. the original library structures and
       classes must remain intact - see the discussions at the end of
       section 2 of the LGPL).  A program running with the "standard"
       virtual machine linked against your distribution of the "standard"
       libraries should not encounter your proprietary class.

       To accomplish this, you would need to modify the classloading
       mechanisms in the JEMCC virtual machine to appropriately "pick up"
       your class implementation instead of the original one at the
       appropriate time.  The modifications you make to the virtual machine
       to accomplish this would fall under the LGPL, but your proprietary
       code would not.

    d) There is one waiver granted by the author to the conditions described
       in (b) above.  In situations where a proprietary modification is
       made to the JEMCC libraries for your application where revealing
       such modifications would compromise the security of your application
       or organization, the requirement to release your modifications is
       hereby waived.  This applies whether your changes are a complete or
       partial modification of one or more components of the source
       distribution.  Any such proprietary code must still be linked to your
       application outside of the standard JEMCC libraries as described
       in (c) above.  This waiver does *not* grant permission to incorporate
       malicious mechanisms intended to prevent users from exercising their
       rights to the virtual machine as described above and in the LGPL but
       only provides for protection of security code and data specific to your
       application or organization.

    NOTE: In the above descriptions, the term "libraries" refers to the
    binary linking libraries containing the core of the virtual machine and
    the associated JEMCC implementations of the standard Java packages.

2) The 'jemcc_builder' program contained in the 'tools' directory is licensed
   under the GPL, as it is not intended for release with any application.
   Any modifications to this program must likewise be released under the
   terms of the GPL.

   However, the *output* of this program, being based entirely on your
   provided input, is not bound under any license associated with the JEMCC
   distribution.  This program is provided for your private use in the
   generation of your own JEMCC-based implementations of Java libraries
   for your application.  The copyright and licensing of the resulting output
   of the program is up to you.  The copyright information that is output
   with the -c option is used is strictly for the convenience of the author
   in producing the JEMCC libraries and should not be considered binding on
   you in any way (nor does it license the program under the LGPL).

3) The contents of the 'testsuite' directory provide a complete regression
   test system for the JEMCC distribution and are also licensed under the GPL
   as they are not intended for redistribution with an application.

   Should you be developing your own Java virtual machine, you may choose
   to incorporate/redistribute the non-JEMCC-specific test programs (for
   example, mauve and indigo) with your own distribution as part of your
   regression testsuite.  This is acceptable provided that you follow the
   terms of the GPL, which is straightforward should you be releasing your
   implementation under the GPL.  If you are releasing your implementation
   under the LGPL (as the JEMCC virtual machine is), you may still include
   the testsuite provided that you maintain a dual LGPL/GPL licensing as
   has been done here (where the included testsuite components remain a
   GPL licensed entity).  If you are developing a proprietary virtual
   machine, you cannot bundle the test programs with it, but you could
   release them as a separate, GPL licensed distribution.  All of these
   conditions only apply to the repackaging and redistribution of the test
   components - any developer of a virtual machine, be it open-source or
   proprietary, is freely permitted to run these programs against their
   machine for the purposes of testing and debugging.

   NOTE: the 'mauve' components contained in the 'testsuite' directory do
   not contain or incorporate any source code that originates from the
   official Mauve test collection produced by Cygnus/RedHat.  All of these
   test programs have been written by the author utilizing the Mauve base
   API's for compatibility and are somewhat too rigorous and JEMCC centric
   for general consumption.  As much as possible, the tests contained
   therein have been passed onto RedHat for inclusion into the official
   (generic) Mauve distribution.

4) The implementation of the JEMCC virtual machine and associated Java
   package library implementations has been performed by the author in
   a "clean-room" manner.  No examination/review of Java source code from
   Sun or other non-GPL sources has occured, aside from the Javadocs and
   programming interfaces which are publicly published by Sun.  The only
   exception to this is the Java Swing package set (due to work with Sun
   on an application which required such review) - as a result, no
   implementation of the Swing packages will ever be included in the JEMCC
   distribution.

   Under the terms described above you are obligated to release any
   non-proprietary modifications made to the JEMCC source and hopefully
   return them to the author for inclusion in subsequent releases.  However,
   any such modifications which compromise the "clean-room" development
   of JEMCC (e.g. changes made having ever reviewed any Sun or other
   non-GPL source code) should *not*, under any circumstances, be returned
   to the author or incorporated in the JEMCC release, for obvious legal
   reasons.  If you are unsure of your status, please assume the worst case
   scenario - let the author know of any problems or required enhancements,
   but do not provide any source details.  If you choose to compromise your
   own redistribution of the JEMCC virtual machine, you must:

     - clearly indicate in your modifications to the source code that they
       are not "clean-room", to avoid accidental incorporation into the
       original JEMCC source distribution by unsuspecting third parties

     - clearly indicate in your application that a modified version of
       the JEMCC virtual machine is in use which incorporates other
       code which may be otherwise licensed

     - make your own legal arrangements regarding the use of the other
       source code (licensed or not)

<LEGAL_NOTE>
All of the above statements are intended to clarify your ability to use this
software with or as part of other applications and should not restrict your
rights to utilize the software according to the appropriate GPL/LGPL terms.
Should any of the above statements unduly restrict your rights to use the
software according to the terms of the associated license, said statement,
and only that statement, shall be considered null and void.  Should any of the
above statements grant you additional rights to use the software beyond those
described in the associated license, that is permitted and the statement is
valid.
</LEGAL_NOTE>
